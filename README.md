This project showcases my experience with Node.js, Express.js, and EJS. The goal was to develop a web server using Node.js and Express.js for routing and middleware, while EJS was utilized as the templating engine to generate dynamic HTML.

## Features

- **Post Creation**: Users can create new posts.

## Deployment with Render

This project is deployed using Render's free hosting service. Please note:
- **Temporary Storage**: Since Render's free tier does not include a persistent database, any data created may be lost during redeployments.
- **Limitations**: As this deployment lacks a database, itâ€™s recommended to use this for demonstration purposes only. For production use, consider integrating a persistent storage solution.
