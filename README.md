# CSULB Tech News Blog

This project demonstrates my experience in Node.js, Express.js, and EJS. The main objective was to build a web server using Node.js and Express.js. Express.js was used to handle routing and middleware.

EJS was used as the templating engine to generate dynamic HTML based on the application's state.
